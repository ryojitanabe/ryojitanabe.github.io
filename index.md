* 2019.12.2 I joined [Yokohama National University](https://www.ynu.ac.jp/english/), Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, as a tenure-track Assistant Professor. I also won [the Leading Initiative for Excellent Young Researchers (LEADER) award](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-le/index.html) from JSPS (21,000,000 JPY).
    * [Yokohama City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama) is close to Tokyo. It takes only about 30 minutes from the center of Tokyo to Yokohama by train. It also takes only about 30 minutes from Tokyo International Airport to Yokohama by shuttle bus.
